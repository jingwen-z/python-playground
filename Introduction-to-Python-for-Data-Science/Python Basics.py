### Hello Python

## The Python Interface
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)

## Any comments?
# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

# Addition works too
print(7 + 10)

## Python as a calculator
# Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)

# Modulo
print(18 % 7)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * 1.1 ** 7)
